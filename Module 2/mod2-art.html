		<h1>Module 2: MIDI Joystick - Blog Post</h1>
		<h2>General Motivation</h2>
		<p>We were prompted by Prof. Santolucito to create an interactive device that creates some output using a joystick and button.</p>
		<h2>Specific Project Motivation</h2>
		<p>MIDI controllers are a core component of music production in the 21st century. The MIDI standard's ease of use has made it ubitquitous in recording software such as Logic Pro or Garageband in addition to performance software such as Mainstage. Mainstage in particular has interested me as it is the industry standard for many live performances with pre-programmed sounds (or "patches") in a defined order, making it ideal for performances such as Broadway shows and even rock concerts (Billy Joel's synthesizer player uses the <a href="https://youtu.be/EAKXjzzCiA8">software on tour</a>!). While MIDI itself is an open standard and many of the softwares available are free to use, MIDI controllers themselves are often less accessible. They come in a variety of form factors from traditional keyboards to more grid-like devices like the <a href="https://novationmusic.com/en/launch/launchpad-x">Novation Launchpad</a>. As keyboards with MIDI outputs also come at hefty premiums, my hope was to create a MVP (minimum viable product) of a DIY MIDI controller with nontraditional inputs. Here the hardware acts as the controller itself while the Python script acts as firmware that connects to software such as Mainstage. For more information on the Python script and the other technical details, see the documentation <a href="mod2-tech.html">here</a>. Being able to emulate the functionality of a MIDI controller opens up a variety of possibilities for unique interaction methods utilizing the MIDI standard with a similar setup.</p>

		<h2>Interaction Methods</h2>
		<p>The general concept of the device is that the two buttons (pressing the joystick and pushing the button) act similarly to pressing keys on a keyboard and holding a sustain pedal, respectively. To change what pitch will be played with a joystick press, a user can move the joystick up and down to change what pitch a joystick press will correspond to. Because both buttons are binary inputs and have no detection of how hard they are being pressed, the other joystick direction (side to side) sets the MIDI velocity, altering how "hard" the joystick press is equivalent to.</p>

		<h2>Enclosure</h2>
		<p>This device is intended to be a proof of concept of a non-commercial MIDI controller. To further this aim I decided that using household materials such as a wood block to depress the button, cardboard, and vinyl would help to emphasize the DIY nature of the controller, as opposed to more commercial controllers such as Novations. My hope is that further iterations of this MIDI controller would have more "commercial-looking" enclosures made out of plastic or acrylic to reflect the progression of the design.</p>
